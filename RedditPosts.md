[Offer] I just finished a pinescript strategy that we turned into a live trading bot. Ready for another project.

The script had indicators, backtesting, and used alert webhooks connected to my webserver to make trades. Im available to write out your strategy and set up your indicators and connect your marketplace accounts for live trading.

Im taking projects starting at $50 for something simple and willing to negotiate on more complex projects.

Lets chat.

[for hire] Ill make a one-page web scraper with notifications for $50
For Hire
For $50, Ill make a web scraper for you that will grab all the content of a site and notify you when the site changes.

The scraper will run on one page, and the page cannot be behind an authentication wall. The notifications will be either email or telegram, your choice.

All I need from you is a website url. Turnaround is quick. Less than 1 hours per page.

Ill run the bot for 1 month straight free. After that, Ill give you the code and show you how to run it.
